I've been coding for fun and profit since 2012 and used to be a 3D Animation and VFX technical artist. I dabble in a little of everything, predominantly working with Python and Go, and to a lesser extent C/C++ and Java. My day job involves building for the web as a full-stack developer. At the moment, I'm very interested in network programming for distributed system, machine learning for vision applications, and a little bit of systems programming. I enjoy 3D printing, hobby electronics, and making beautiful and useful things.
