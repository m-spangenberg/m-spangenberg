Iâ€™ve been coding for fun and profit since 2012, with a background as a 3D Animation and VFX technical artist. These days, I work primarily as a full-stack developer, building web applications that solve real business problemsâ€”mostly in Python and Go, with some other languages sprinkled in. Iâ€™m passionate about systems that are both beautiful and functional, and I like working across the stack to make that happen.

Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into network programming, distributed systems, and machine learningâ€”especially for vision-based and unsupervised applications. I'm also exploring systems programming, domain-driven design, and software architecture to level up my ability to build scalable, resilient systems. Outside of work, I tinker with 3D printing, hobby electronics, and anything that lets me create something both useful and elegant.
