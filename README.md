I'm currently building software solutions and pipelines for enterprise customers. I've been coding for fun and profit since 2012 and used to be a 3D Animation and VFX technical artist. I dabble in a little of everything, predominantly working with Python and Go, but I try to be practical about not having a toolbox full of hammers. Right this minute I'm exploring Distributed Systems, Network Programming, and Machine Learning.
